# Portfolio
This week I started on my portfolio. I followed a figma design to as much precision as possible. 
The task was took a while to complete because of all the css that needed to be applied and to make it resposiveness. The html and css have been laid out but have not personalised the content of the portfolio. 
Accessibility rules were added to try and make it better for screen readers, but this can be worked on more in the future. 
For extra features I added a toggle to switch between light and dark themes, and a back to top button since the portfolio would require quite a bit of scrolling when viewd on mobile screens.
